This is a simple bash script adapted from remindmeto that runs infinitely setting reminders for the user to remind them to take a 15 minute break every hour when doing work. 

Make the program executable using chmod 755.

To run the program: ./breakReminder 

N.B: You can either sacrifice a tty session to run this or run it on a thread and kill the process manually when youâ€™ve finished working.
